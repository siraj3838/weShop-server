1/ Leveraging JWT (JSON Web Tokens), your backend ensures secure authentication and authorization processes, allowing users to access their accounts and perform actions securely. This helps protect sensitive user data and ensures that only authorized users can access restricted resources.

2/ With features such as JWT authentication, MongoDB for efficient data management, and CORS support for seamless communication, our project prioritizes security and scalability. Users can trust that their data is protected, while administrators have the flexibility to scale the platform as needed to accommodate growing demands.

3/ With CORS enabled, your backend can safely handle requests from frontend clients hosted on different domains. This enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring that users can interact with your e-commerce platform without encountering any cross-origin issues.
